* To get the correct local IP information update the network interfaces used. In my case they are named `enp3s0` and `wlp2s0`
* To get the temperature data make sure you have `lm-sensors` packaged installed
* `own_window_argb_value` propery controls the alpha (transparency) of the background. Use values from 0 (for no background) to 255 (for full background)
* `color0` propery is used to set the color of labels displayed
